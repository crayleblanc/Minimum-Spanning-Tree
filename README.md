Dependencies: Numpy, Math, and Functools<br /><br/>
A program to give the minimum spanning tree and all equivalent minimum spanning trees for a given adjacency matrix.<br/><br/>
The pdf problem2_graph_representation is a drawing of a graph that tests the functionality of outputing the equivalent minimum spanning trees. In this instance, there are three.
